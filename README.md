# TACO_MJS
This multi-label classification model is based on the TACO dataset (http://tacodataset.org/). The aim is to detect different kind of trash, this can be used for automatic trash separation. I want to see the impact of image augmentation on model performance. 

This is inspired by the amazing project with Neatleaf, where we could unfortunately not showcase our code on gitHub, as we were working on their code base and with their images. As a result I am thrilled to apply the gained knowledge on a new dataset, a topic that is also close to my heart, preserving and protecting nature.

# Workflow

1. Sight the data and the data structure. Instead of the data beeing dispersed in 15 different Folders (not sorted by classes - random) and the annotations beeing in a json file, I prefer to have the images all in one folder and the corresponding annotations in a csv file to more easily select labels or split the dataset.


2. Set up base model

3. Apply image augmentation

4. Hyperparameter tuning (e.g. exponential learning late)

5. Use Explainable AI to see what the model is seeing
